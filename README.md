# Goblin Admonisher

You're the mayor of a town that's been being raided by goblins from a nearby dungeon.

It's on you to go and visit the dungeon and tell them to CUT it OUT!

Goblin Admonisher is a web-based roguelike programmed in ES6, primarily to get my (mcccclean) chops ready for March 2016's 7DRL contest.
